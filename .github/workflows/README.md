### Explanation of different build types

**NOTE**: There are three build stages checking current and future compatibility of the package.

[Detailed build status](.github/workflows/README.md)

1. Binary builds - against released packages (main and testing) in ROS distributions. Shows that direct local build is possible.

1. Source build - also core ROS packages are build from source. It shows potential issues in the mid future.
